## Documentation: Role-Based User Management System


---

### 1. **Overview**

This system is designed to facilitate role-based access for different types of users, allowing specific permissions for managing financial records, user accounts, and organizational data. Superadmins can create and manage users, assign roles, and restrict access to specific features based on assigned roles.

The system includes the following roles:

- **Superadmin**: Full control over the system. Superadmins can create users, assign roles, manage accounts, and define permissions.
- **Admin**: Similar to Superadmins but with slightly fewer privileges. Admins can manage users within specific domains but cannot create new roles or assign them to Superadmins.
- **Manager**: Managers can access financial data such as income statements, balance sheets, etc., and manage bookkeepers.
- **Bookkeeper**: Can perform CRUD operations related to transaction management, bill, and invoice creation.
- **Data Entry**: Basic role that allows users to create user data and upload user information.

### 6. **Conclusion**

The implementation of a role-based user management system ensures that users can only access the features and data relevant to their roles, enhancing security and ensuring efficient management. The system's architecture is designed for scalability.


The complete development of the system, including frontend and backend development, role-based access control integration will take approximately 20 working days to complete.
